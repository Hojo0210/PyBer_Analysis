# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Using a dataset from the city_data.csv and the ride_data.csv, a new dataframe was made to show the total rides, drivers, and fare amount, as well as the average fare and average fare per driver. This dataframe was then used to make an additional dataframe to show the sum of the fares for a given range of dates. The range used was 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-28, but this code could be refactored for any date that we have data for. This was then pivoted to show the total fare for each city type, on a weekly basis. This final dataframe was used to create a line chart to show the total fares by city type across the given date range.
